        <h1>The Role of Responsive Design in Modern Web Development</h1>
        <p>In the era of diverse devices and screen sizes, responsive design has become an essential aspect of modern web development. It ensures that websites adapt seamlessly to various screen resolutions, providing users with a consistent and enjoyable experience, whether they are browsing on a smartphone, tablet, or desktop.</p>

        <h2>Why Responsive Design Matters</h2>
        <p>Responsive design improves user experience by eliminating the need for horizontal scrolling, zooming, or pinching. A well-designed responsive website adjusts layouts, images, and content dynamically to match the screen size, making it easier for users to navigate and engage with the site.</p>

        <h2>Core Principles of Responsive Design</h2>
        <p>1. **Fluid Grid Layouts:** Use percentages instead of fixed pixel widths for layout elements to ensure flexibility.</p>
        <p>2. **Flexible Images:** Scale images appropriately to prevent them from overflowing their containers.</p>
        <p>3. **Media Queries:** Apply CSS rules conditionally based on screen size and orientation.</p>

        <h2>The Impact on SEO</h2>
        <p>Responsive design plays a significant role in search engine optimization (SEO). Google prioritizes mobile-friendly websites, and responsive design helps achieve better rankings by offering a unified user experience across all devices.</p>
